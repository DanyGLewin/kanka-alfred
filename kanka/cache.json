After they let the man go, Elara snuck into his apartment to see if she could find any evidence, and she found a crossbow in a chest near a window overlooking the plaza. Meanwhile, Besh and Pasi guarded the appartment, and Besh noticed the other tenant on the third floor was an Orange Wizard. At the same time, Kota flew down the stairs to continue the search, but was held back by a couple members of the city guard who wanted to question him.</p>\n<p>When the others finished their business on the third floor, they joined Kota at the bottom, and told the guards that they suspected the man on the third floor.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, they went to look for Alamania, and found her in a small street behind the [location:288998], along with Ravani and <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/events/9069/Nellita\">a girl</a>. They introduced themselves, and Alamania said that she's glad to see more people loyal to her cause, and that they would surely meet again.</p>\n",

They learned that his name is <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/79266\">Shoreman Dumol</a>, that he is a traveling merchant, and that he is leaving for <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/locations/2969\">Latormeio</a> soon. Meanwhile, Kota and Pasi went upstairs to see if they could find more incriminating evidence, but had to back off when they found a guard questioning the <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/79286\">other tenant</a> on the third floor.</p>\n<p>The gang decided to follow the tracks they found earlier, which led them to a small warehouse, where they saw Shoreman overseeing people loading crates onto horse carts. In the werhouse were sixteen other people: four mercenary guards, five cartdrivers, and seven others, three of whom were children. They waited until the following morning, when the Shoreman and his men left on the <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/locations/78805\">Gold Road</a>, headed for Latormeio.</p>\n<p>Our heroes followed Shoreman's caravan until they made camp for the night, when they decided they ould attempt to kidnap Shoreman. Kota and Pasi came up to the camp, and tried to distract them with a circus performance, and for one of their tricks they asked Shoreman to leave the camp with Pasi. As they past some trees, Elara and Besh swiftly tied and gagged him. Kota joined the others, and as they investigated the trader, they realized that he was innocent, and that it was someone else who had shot Alamania. They sneakily returned him to the camp, and headed back to the city.</p>\n<p>The next day, they tried to find out more information about Alamania and [character:288343]. They found out that he was from a poor family of fishermen and that he used to frequent <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/locations/78968\">The Salted Shrimp</a>, but then he came across a large sum of money, moved to a richer part of the city, and stopped going there. Later, at The Dancing Dragon, they talked to <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/79375\">Sor Carres</a>, a member of the <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/organisations/459\">City Council</a>\u00a0who is a known supporter of Elyas. After a brief talk and a large bribe from Shoreman's stolen wallet, Carres agreed to arrange them a meeting with Rynaio.</p>\n",

On the second day of the journey they encountered a small band of bandits led by a man who called himself \"Lord Heslin\" and his sister, an Orange Wizard named Gremia. After a short skirmish the Puma Pals bested the bandits and questioned Germia. She explained that they lived peacefully (-ish) in [location:316393]\u00a0up until to weeks prior, when someone on the [organisation:6180]\u00a0decided to send a squad of the city guard to evict them. The guards slaughtered the bandits, and only four of them managed to escape. [character:288997]\u00a0mentioned that there were no guards in the town when they had arrived, which seemed strange to the others.</p>\n<p>A few days later the Puma Pals reached the city. They decided to split up: [character:288353]\u00a0and [character:300697]\u00a0would go to the Blue Temple to search for clues about the locations of any of the Stones, while [character:288347], [character:288355], and [character:288997]\u00a0would go to the White Temple to look for the White Stone.</p>\n<p>In the White Temple, Ellara snooped around the First Priest's\u00a0study and found nothing out of the ordinary, except a small gap in the wall that stretched from the floor to the ceiling, was about a centimeter wide, and seemed to go all the way through it. She snuck out when just before the Priest arrived, and asked to speak with him about a study that she's doing. She asked him about the White Stone which he knew nothing about, stating that everyone always says it's in the temple, but he never saw it himself, and neither did his predecessor nor his predecessor's predecessor. When asked about the crack in the wall he explained that a couple of weeks ago he accidentally pushed the desk onto the wall and that gap formed, and he always forgets to call someone to have it fixed.</p>\n<p>In the Blue Temple, Kota and Araki find manuscripts and letters mentioning the White Stone being used by a White Priest around 800 years ago, but can't seem to find any source more recent than that. They do however find a few letters from a couple of years ago between a Lord Mikkel in Lattormeio and the First Priest in Haeven's Black Temple, mentioning the Yellow and Orange Stones. They decide to pick up the other Puma Pals and go to investigate the Black Temple.</p>\n<p>In the Black Temple they head straight for the First Priest's study and Kota barges in. [character:403753]\u00a0is not impressed and tells them to return later, but concedes to let them in after some insistence. She admits that a couple of years ago she was contacted by a trader from [location:6175]\u00a0who claimed to have found the Yellow and Orange Stones, but after meeting with him and a Yellow Priest from [location:6179]\u00a0called [character:291114]\u00a0she concluded that the Stones were fake and ceased communications with them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kota excused himself from the room, and after the others followed and asked what happened he revealed that he knew Okada.</p>\n",

She was a Purple Wizard, and became enchanted by her father's magic. Her older brother is much older than her, and he was born like her mother, so her father hid him away when he was born. Her twin brother was also born like her mother, while she herself was more similar to her father. He left her mother and twin brother with nothing, while he took her in with him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She's pretty sure her mother died a couple of years ago, but has no idea what happened to her brothers, or even what they're like, except that they are both Wizards.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She asks Besh if he could kill her father for leaving leaving her family to die.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She doesn't remember her face or her namme, but she remembers is that he's rich, that they lived in a big house near the center of Polaris, and that she's pretty sure she met him outside the Council's Keep on the night she was captured by Araki.</p>\n",

With the help of a [character:405807] we found\u00a0[character:405205], the lord who used to have The Orange Stone (Perhaps he also used to have the yellow stone, but according to [character:300697] he doesn't have it anymore. I only trust this man for [character:288353]\u00a0sake.), and he said he'd already sold it to [character:339905]. Turns out my father became a lord in the last 15 years. Luckily enough, he was also the past owner of [character:288997], so she knew who would want to help us with our heist for personal vengeance. After much convincing, [character:405811], a busines rival of Mark Evergreen's and another person who hates him, gave us costumes to use when we enter and advice on what to say.</p>\n<p>And so we went to Mark's house, and right at the entrance, we met someone we know- [character:310275], a slave from Shoreman's group. Kota spent most of his time in the Evergreen mansion convincing the kid to help us and run with us. [character:288355]\u00a0solved the loose end that was the wife: calmed her down so that she didn't even consider checking on us to see what we were doing. The three of them together stole Mark's gold and burned his files. No wonder they're the first friends I've made in years. Me, Araki and Nelli went with Mark to his office, and Araki made him busy with boat-talk (maybe I should've read more about boats, back at the temple) while I enchanted his finger to itch so that he'd take it off. I made an illusion of the ring being at a different place than where it actually were, and the moment he got out of the room, we stole The Orange Stone from Mark and took off immediately. Nelli even burned his house down, I'm starting to like her a lot.</p>\n<p>We're outside Latormeio now. We have two Stones on Ellara, two children to take care of if we're not counting Kota (hehe. I'm gonna tell him that.) and six more stones to find.</p>\n",

            "entry": "\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">They plan to go to Alamania's house, before leaving the Dancing Dragon, Pasi says that he's not feeling well and would rather stay in the inn. He feels tired and a bit weak, and he looks slightly pale.</p>\n<p>Two nights prior, Shoreman gave <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/85379\">Tarninan</a> a gift: necklace with <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/items/25119\">bright red beads</a>. He wanted to make sure the kid was didn't try to use his magic to escape during the ride to Lattormeio, and thus way the child would believe got sick from something in the forests. However, during Kota and Pasi's performance, he gave the necklace to Pasi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Elara knows that Alamania lives somewhere on the Gold Road, near the God's Garden. They get to her house and Nelli opens the door. She's wearing a plain red nightgown that does not seem appropriate to the season. Last time they saw her she was wearing a bright red scarf, but now she isn't and on her bare neck they see two branded quarter-circles on her neck, one on the right and one on the left.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She asks of they came to see her mother, inviting them in, saying she made a lot of food. Kota gets the feeling that he recognizes her from somewhere, but he has no idea from where.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alamania shares how she isn't actually a goddess, her body is human but that since she was little the Black goddess came to her in her dreams, saying she had part of her soul in lieu of the Stone. She doesn't want others to know, but she knows they are loyal to her, and they haven't yet saved their last life.</p>\n<p>If they ask how she knows she'll say that she knows them, she Elara's talents wasted away in her childhood, she saw Kota wearing another face - a false face, and she even saw Besh studying, that he will know things that no one knew before him and few will know after.</p>\n<p>Nelli comes in holding an iron pot filled with delicious smelling cauliflower and mushroom soup in her bare hands. She sets it down on the table while warning the others that it's hot, whole winking at Elara. She then gives her a weird look asking her if they've met before, besides the other day after Alamania was shot.</p>\n<p>If they ask about her, she will show them her brand and explain that she was a slave in Latormeio until Alamania bought her, freed her, then took her in as a daughter. She hopes for a day where children,\u00a0 especially Wizard children, aren't sold or kidnapped into slavery.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The following morning Hendricson gives Elara a note saying \"413, Cherry Street\" and bearing two signatures: ER (<a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/78366\">Elyas Rinayo</a>), and SC (<a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/79375\">Sor Carres</a>).</p>\n<p>The address leads them to a small inn, called the <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/locations/83846\">Green Gate inn</a>. It's on the border of one of the poorest neighbourhoods in the city, Greenleaf Town. Sitting at a table outside, near the entrance, are two big brawny men, one of whom eyes them suspiciously as they enter. Inside they see four tables, with Elyas sitting besides on of them. Besides the table behind him sit five men, two of whom look like sellswords. On the table near the entrance are two other armed men.</p>\n<p>Elyas invites them to his table, greeting Elara and Kota by name. He asks them what it is they wanted to discuss with him.</p>\n<p>If asked about his political stance he will claim that contrary to popular belief, he doesn't hate Wizards, though he knows many who do. He does, however, despise how Alamania is ripping the city apart. He might mention that many people dislike the circus' coming, because many non-Wizards see it as an insult, while many pro-Wizards see it as unnecessary provocation.</p>\n<p>If and about his past he will reveal that he was raised in a family of fishermen on the east bank. If asked about his sponsors he will mention that they all have placed to be: Kota should be rehearsing, Elara should be in another tavern, Besh should be in a book or something, and he himself is expecting a meeting with someone else.</p>\n",

A while back she had a vision of a place where something is hidden, something very important that will help them in the coming struggle. She invites <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/78368\">Besh</a>\u00a0to take the vision from her mind so that he could lead the others there.</p>\n<p>He sees the ocean, above it soar basalt cliffs two hundred meters tall. Rapid winds buffet his face as he climbs the air up and over the top of the cliff. As he stares out over the ocean he notices a cave below him, overlooking the woods. To his right he cas see the black cliffs of [location:5988] in the distance, and to his left rise the <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/locations/78748\">Alanashu Mountains</a>, vanishing into the clouds. He dives down to the entrance of the cave peering into the darkness, and he sees a faint glimmer within.</p>\n<p>Alamania says that she will be leaving the city, taking hold of [location:316393], and calling the\u00a0 other Wizards in the city to join her there. For the three of them it will be a three day trek to the cave and a four day return journey to Spearhill.</p>\n<p>On the second night, a pack of wolves attacks during <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/78370\">Kota's</a>\u00a0shift.

In total there are three small wolves and one large wolf. If any two wolves are killed/knocked out, the others will flee.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After meeting with the mountain lions, as they cross the Gold road they meet two people walking on the road: a man named Gerensil, (40ish, wearing old traveling clothes and carrying a large pack) and a teen named Kanshanor (17, wearing a simple black tunic and with a far smaller pack). Geren introduces themselves as people from Applehill, and says that they were on the march for two days. He adds that Kanshi is a priest in the village's temple, and as a black Wizard (apprars to be 1), he wanted to see Alamania and study under her guidance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kanshi asks them if they are also headed towards her, as the three Wizards seem an odd company to be alone on the Road. Geren asks if they would like to share the road with them, mentioning that he himself is a good hunter, and he saw some meaty-looking does by the side of the road.</p>\n<p>At night, all three of them have dreams:</p>\n<p>Kota is sitting in the Blue Temple with Araki, playing with the water in the fountain. They're talking about Kota's training and Araki's studies. They both have chores to do, but they don't care too much, they'll do them later. Kota splashes a big wave at Araki's arm, and Araki laughingly gives him a weak punch in the chest. It hurts. Kota's tied up, the cult is going on with the ritual. A bolt of lightning arcs from one of their hands and hits him in the chest. One of the people removes his cloak, revealing himself as Araki. He comes closer to Kota and whispers in his ear. The voice that comes out of his mouth isn't his, it's the one from his last dream, and it says \"Kota, ignore it,\u00a0it doesn't matter now. We need you. Wake up\" And he wakes up.</p>\n<p>Besh is in his hometown, sorting the inn's mail. He's still young, hoping against all odds to see a letter from his father. He finishes sorting them. There's a lot of letters: some for people staying at the inn, some of people making reservations, some for the innkeeper, and one for himself. He lazily opens it and skims the beginning: something about demons or whatever. Boring. He notices another envelope on the table, right in the middle. He has no idea how he missed it before, but there it was. It's a small envelope made of brown crumply paper, with no name or address written on it. It's unsealed. He peeks inside a d theres a small folded paper, with one thing written on it: \"Wake up\".</p>\n<p>Elara is in her community. Her father said that she needs to read a book about something or other to help her get to terms with her magic, but she doesn't really want to, it's been weeks since she last set something on fire by accident, over a month since she caused real harm.

It's mid-morning, they leave their quarters in the town's temple ([character:6181]\u00a0in the middle of the night to help him heal.</p>\n<p>Alamania is indisposed at the moment, talking to someone important in her study. As they step out of the temple, they suddenly feel all the magic about them. Even Ellara can feel the magic in the air. There are so many Wizards, it feels so strange, they never saw that many Wizards in one place before. Even the non-Wizards in the town feel it.</p>\n<p>Everyone is moving about, helping restore the town, fixing buildings, and setting up stores.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The night after they leave, <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/78541\">Nelli</a> gets a hunch (actually the <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/88997\">Red Goddess</a>\u00a0telling her) that she should go with them. She tells <a title=\"A mysterious woman with extremely powerful Black magic, Alamania claims to be the embodiment of the Black Goddess.\" href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/2262\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\">her mother</a>. Alamania suggests she send <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/78538\">Ravani</a> with her, but Nelli insists that she should go alone, so she rides after them.</p>\n<p>A few nights ago, [character:300697] heard about Alamania's claim of being the Black Goddess. He pleaded the head of <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/locations/81354\">his temple</a>\u00a0 to let him go and meet her. He arrived in the <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/locations/86012\">Blue Temple of Polaris</a>\u00a0on the morning when the gang left Spearhill, and saw that the <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/locations/81352\">Colours of the World Circus</a> was in town. He asked about Kota, and learned that he was helping an injured friend who was staying in the <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/locations/91108\">Black Temple</a>. He went there the following morning, but found out that Kota wasn't there. He met <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/78369\">Pasi</a>, who was already healthy, to stay with him in the Blue Temple, since he heard that the city is not the safest place at the moment, but Pasi declined, saying that he'd wait for Besh and the others to return.</p>\n<p>As Araki heads to the temple, he sees a little girl dressed in rags talking to some servants just outside the Council Quarters' gate. They're standing out in the snow and the servants are quivering from the cold despite their warm coats, but she looks just fine in her bare feet. At first he doesn't see any magic around her, but after a moment he sees a fine haze emanating from her hands and entering their heads. He realizes that she's a demon, and quickly runs to the nearby Purple Temple. He calls for help, and then three Purple priests and he go to stop the demon. She resists and kills two of the priests: she makes one of them run through another with his sword, and she sets the third on fire. Araki and the remaining priest managed to knock her out and took her to the Temple, where they tied her arms and legs and threw her in the dungeon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When she woke up a few hours later she cried and begged that the guards let her talk to Araki, refering to him as \"the unseen blue\". He was waiting in the temple, hoping to study her when she awoke, so he came down, and after begging to be released she offered him a deal: she won't resist or try to escape, and in return he'll let her talk with \"the golden key, and its blue and red companions\" when they return to the city. He accepteda went to the Black temple, where he left a letter with Pasi.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to him, the girl (named Toumeri) have the servants</p>\n",

Ask Ronit where Ellara sees herself: somewhere relaxing, where she feels comfortable. She feels calm, at peace, in a way she didn't feel in a long time. A character walks up to her, a teen in a green dress. She introduces herself as the <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/89000\">Green Goddess</a>, and tells Ellara that if she wants, she could try to make her into her unofficial desciple. She doesn't want to officially turn her into a desciple, since that would require \"awakening\", which would be very dangerous with the new revelation that there are demons about. Additionally, she isn't sure what linking Ellara to the <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/items/23545\">Green Stone</a>\u00a0would actually do to her, since the only precedent for a Wizard being bound to a differently coloured Stone is of a <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/tags/23148\">Yellow Wizard</a> with the <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/items/23546\">Purple Stone</a>, and both the Wizard and the Stone are very special exceptions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Ellara agrees, the Goddess tells her that she'll tell [character:6181]\u00a0to return the Stone to her, and if Alamania refuses, she'll try to force her subtly.</p>\n<p>If Ellara refuses, the Goddess asks her to reconsider, saying that while she thinks Alamania is on the right side, she thinks the <a href=\"https://kanka.io/en/campaign/888/characters/89005\">Black Goddess</a>\u00a0is planning something, and she doesn't want to trust her as long as she doesn't know what she's up to. If Ellara still refuses, the Goddess accepts it gracefully and returns Ellara to her dream.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",

Goes to a building with the city's crest on it's door. Knocks, but gets no answer. After knocking again he tries to open the door, revealing an office with five dead men, with stab wounds and foam in their mouths.</p>\n<p>He hides inside until a young man with black hair and the clothes of a Yellow Priest comes in.</p>\n<p>Araki goes down a staircase with 6 armed guards. They open a door and a fight ensues. He sees something small glowing Yellow on the floor. There's a bright Yellow flash.</p>\n<p>People are dying, there's blood everywhere. Araki uses his magic to hide in the corner of the room, trying to reach Kota who's lying on the floor, but it's so hectic. Arrows and swords and lightning and blood are all moving so fast. It all happened so fast.</p>\n<p>After the fighting, Kota is lying on the floor. Araki is on his knees and sees that Kota isn't breathing. He tries to use his magic to no avail. He takes something out of his pocket.</p>\n<p>Earlier that evening Araki was talking to a Black Priest, and the Priest gives him something.</p>\n<p>Araki begs the Black Stone to tell him what to do. He takes a knife from one of the bodies and cuts open Kota's chest, then inserts the Stone between his ribs. He steps back. After a few seconds Kota begins to glow with a bright Black Light, and the cut on his chest closes, leaving a feint scar, blending with the many marks that the lightning left behind. When he wakes up, Araki asks him who he is.</p>\n<p>The two are walking in the streets of Umigate, distant lights of a Mid-Winter Festival are glowing over the rooftops. Araki's hiding them with his magic, while Kota walks beside him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/1uFfUnP0v76OKh6MeLJyoK\">https://open.spotify.com/track/1uFfUnP0v76OKh6MeLJyoK</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fantasy Music - Firefly Glow (Youtube)<br />Green Goddess Dream music<br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KabGpdjrhnQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KabGpdjrhnQ</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dark Lullaby Music - Starlight Watch (Youtube)</p>\n<p>Last god / demon dreams</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/j9wNKrw5k70\">https://youtu.be/j9wNKrw5k70</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Medieval Music - Oldwood Village (Youtube)</p>\n<div>The Community / Besh's Village</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXU0v35EWKM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXU0v35EWKM</a></p>\n",

When given the job, Mikkel gave him a ring embedded with a bright orange gemstone, and a large yellow stone to be delivered in person. When he got to the [location:403752]\u00a0he met [character:403753]\u00a0and showed her the Stones, but she believed they were fake.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the way back, while passing under the [location:289005]\u00a0his ship was attacked by pirates. When they busted into his chamber and tried to kill him, their blades bounced off his skin, allowing him to singlehandedly kill or disable most of those attacking him, while the others fled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he stopped in [location:405183]\u00a0he told [character:405184]\u00a0about the Stones, saying that they could make a fortune for themselves and their son, but she insisted that they stay in Summer Pass with her family, not wanting to frighten her son with major changes.</p>\n<p>Upon returning to Lord Mikkal he told him that Corvina decided the stones were fake, but then he asked to buy the stones himself, to which Mikkal accepted.</p>\n<p>Mark started saving money and slowly bought more and more ships. He owns a fleet of over 100 boats and ships all over the world. He also started getting into the mining business, buying slaves and getting them to work in the crystal caverns. 5 years ago a slave in his mine found the Red Stone, and he later gave it to [character:6181]\u00a0(along with [character:288997]) in exchange for a position of power when she retakes Polaris.</p>\n<p>3 years ago he made a deal with [character:291114], giving him the yellow stone, in exchange for the priest researching how it could be used to form a permanent gate that could be used (and monetized) for trading. However, the Stone vanished during a raid on the temple, and Evergreen is very salty about that.</p>\n<p>He got married three times: to a lady from Umigate called <strong>Emika</strong>\u00a0who gave him 2 sons and a daughter, to a lady from [location:6178] named <strong>Fleur</strong>, who gave him 2 daughters, and is currently married to <strong>Lisa</strong>, who is eight months pregnant pregnancy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",
